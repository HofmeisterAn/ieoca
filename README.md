# Intelligent evaluation of complex algorithm

This is one of the first student projects I wrote together with a fellow student and friend in Java. The project researched a component-based approach to evaluate complex algorithms. Based on the research we wrote a paper and published it at the 2014 IEEE 5th International Conference on Software Engineering [978‑1‑4799‑3279‑5](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6933689).
